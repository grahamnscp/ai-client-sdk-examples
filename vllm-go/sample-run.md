2025/10/31 15:47:42 response >>> There is no official measurement of the Mariana Trench, as it is a meaningless term. Instead, the term "Trench" is used as a shorthand description of the deepest part of the Mariana Trench, Puerto Princesa Submerged Landscape Anticline Complex, which lies 3620 meters below sea level on the western side of the Mariana archipelago of the Philippines. The trench is considered one of the hottest places on Earth and an important military command center for halocline data. The official name of the submerged landscape is Puerto Princesa Submersible Trench.
